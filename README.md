 ## API Documentation

 This eCommerce website was built using Spring Boot and REST API, and I used Swagger to document the API endpoints and operations. You can access the Swagger documentation by running the application and navigating to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.

The Swagger documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the API's functionality, including the request and response objects, error codes, and security requirements. It can help other developers understand how to interact with the API and integrate it into their own projects.

By leveraging the power of Swagger, I was able to create a scalable and maintainable API that can be easily extended and updated in the future.
